#  and submitted as follows:
#   Long Course Meters times shall be achieved on or before September 30 (table)
# [In addition, the following was added:]
#++  Times to be considered for records and Top 10 times shall be achieved on or 
#++  before October 10, 2021, for Long Course Meters. This provision will be implemented 
#++  immediately following the conclusion of the annual meeting, expire at the conclusion 
#++  of the LCM National Championship meet and will not be included in the 2022 USMS 
#++  Masters Swimming Code of Regulations and Rules of Competition.”
